# github-action-usage-test

This is a toy project which test how capable is Github Action.

See the demo at https://edwin0cheng.github.io/github-action-usage-test/

TODO:

Currently the code is too messy to hack with:
    
* Refactoring to use action github-script 
* Use `env` instead of file passing 
* Add polling on RA repos to fetch new commits
* Better error handling
